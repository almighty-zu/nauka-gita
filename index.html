    <h1>The Raven</h1>
    <h2>by Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>Only this and nothing more.”<br><br>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>Nameless here for evermore.<br><br>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>This it is and nothing more.”</p>
